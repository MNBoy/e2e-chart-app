# Simple Chat App

This is a simple chat application built with Socket.IO for real-time communication. The project consists of two main components: a server and a client.

## Server

### Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
cd server
pnpm start:dev
```

The server will start running at `localhost:4000`.

## Client

To use the chat application, open the `index.html` file located in the client folder in your web browser. You can access the chat interface and start communicating with other users.
